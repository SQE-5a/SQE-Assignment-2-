# meeting 1 notes 

As we discussed, in the previous meeting with sir in the class that we 
are not that proficient to use amd with the flutter app as chosen by us
i.e NATRIUM, so we discussed to change the project on which we will be 
working on.

## Project Chosen:
`Magento`

## About Magento:
Mangento is an open source website. We will be using it for our selenium
testing.


## Language Chosen:
As discussed in the meeting held today at 11:00 P.M, we discussed that
`python` will be a good choice for us for testing. 

### Packages of Python:
We will be using basically two packages:
#### 1: selenium
#### 2: gherkin-official

## Crux:
We will be using the python with its packages i.e `selenium` and `gherkin-official` for 
testing the GUI of `Magento` website.
